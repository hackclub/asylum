The goal was to have this be both an alarm clock and weather station, with great graphics using LVGL. This however fell short, due to a number of reasons (exams, lack of hardware to test, etc). 
Originally I was going to call an API for the weather, but decided it would be best to do this on board the PCB. I still would like to eventually ad the ability to call an API once I can physically test it. 

The PCB fits with the case, which is less of a case and more of a stand, because I like the bare bones look of the PCB. It uses M3 screws, and should thread itself into the stand.
