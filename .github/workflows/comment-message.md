Hey!! awesome job on this asylum submission. Can't wait to see you build it.

This is just a friendly reminder to make sure your PR follows the example format, including **directory structure**:

- For weather stations: [Example here](https://github.com/hackclub/asylum/tree/main/designs/weather_stations/dari_awesome_example)
- For NFC tags: [Example here](https://github.com/hackclub/asylum/tree/main/designs/nfc_keytags/hack_club_keytag)

The most important part is that you have a README.md file documenting your design. Make sure there are images of your design in it! Otherwise it will *not* be accepted.

This *is* an automated message, so you can ignore it if you have everything already!
